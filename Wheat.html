    <h1>What is Wheat</h1>
</center>
<p>
    Wheat cultivation is more on land than any other crop; 2.5 billion people in 89 countries consume wheat. In 2014 it was grown on 220.4 million hectares. The world wheat trade is more than all other crops combined. Global wheat production, which stood
    at 772 million tonnes in 2017, was the second-largest grain produced after maize, with a production forecast of 766 million tonnes for 2019. Global wheat production and other crops have tripled since 1960 and are expected to increase towards the middle
    of the 21st century. Worldwide, wheat demand has risen because of gluten proteinsâ€™ unique viscoelastic and sticky properties present in wheat. Gluten help in food processing, and processed food consumption is increasing due to the global process of
    industrialization and Western foods.

    Wheat is an essential source of carbohydrates. It is the primary source of plant protein in human food worldwide, with approx. 13%, which is high compared to other whole grains. Wheat growing conditions are more flexible than rice. It is a Rabi crop sown
    in early winter and harvested in early summer. According to Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT), there is more wheat production in China than in any other country. India is second, Russia third, and the US fourth.
    China, India, Russia, the US, France, Australia, Canada, Pakistan, Ukraine, and Germany are the top wheat-producing countries.</p>
