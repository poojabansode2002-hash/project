  <h1><marquee> What is Millet</marquee></h1>
  <p>
    Millets term is used for several grass plant crops. The seeds of millets are collected for human or animal consumption. Millet is an essential crop in the sub-tropics of Asia and Africa, particularly India, Nigeria, and Mali. Its production accounts for 97% of developing countries. 
Compared to other grains, millets are suitable for less fertile soil and can bear harsh grown conditions like little rainfall and burning heat.
Besides, Millets need a short season to grow. Mills are unique in many parts of the world. The most cultivated is pearl millet, an important crop in India and some areas of Africa. 
Finger, foxtail, and proso millet are important crop types. In New Mexico, the commonly grown Millets include pearl hybrid verities and foxtail verities. 
Millets have been consumed by people for about 7,000 years and could play an important role in developing multi-crop farming and the settlement of farming societies.
It is a drought-resistant plant. It is widely grown around the world for use as food and feed.
The United Nations General Assembly recently approved a resolution to celebrate 2023 as the International Year of Millets. India presented the resolution with Bangladesh, Nepal, Kenya, Russia, and Senegal. [8]
