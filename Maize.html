        <h1>What is Maize</h1>
    </center>
    <p>
        Maiz is widely grown around the globe, and the world produces more maize every year than any other grain. Forty percent of world maize production comes from the United States. Other major maize-producing countries are Indonesia, China, India, Brazil,
        Mexico, Argentina, and France. Worldwide, 765 million tons of maize from almost 153 million hectares were harvested in 2010. Approximately 73% of this area is in developing countries. Presently maize is grown on almost 100 million hectares in
        125 developing countries and is one of the three most grown crops in those 75 countries.

        Production can be much higher in some parts of the world; the estimated output in Iowa for 2009 was 11,614 kg/hectare. The evidence contradicts the hypothesis that maize yield potential has increased in recent decades. It suggests that changes in potential
        yield are related to leaf angle, slope resistance, high plant density, disease/pest resistance, and other agricultural characteristics rather than an increase in the output of each plant.
