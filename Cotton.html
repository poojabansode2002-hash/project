        <h1> What is Cotton</h1>
    </center>
    <p>
        Cotton is an important fiber for clothing and many other textile products. The crop has 7,000 years back history. It is grown by many cultures around the world. Four types of cotton are commonly grown: Gossypium hirsutum, Gossypium barbadense, Gossypium
        arboretum, and Gossypium herbaceum. Worldwide cotton production is around 25 million tons annually, with China being the world’s largest cotton producer. The cotton plant is a plant of the tropics and subtropics and requires an equally high temperature
        between 21 ° C and 30 ° C. Its growth decreases when the temperature drops below 20 ° C. Cotton grows in frost-free areas for at least 210 days per year; frost is the enemy of cotton and the cotton plant.</p>
    <p>
        Cotton cultivation requires simple water requirements, averaging 50 to 100 cm of rainfall. It can also grow in fewer rainfall areas with the help of irrigation. In the beginning, sufficient rain and sunny and dry weather during ripening are useful for
        cotton cultivation. Deep black soil is the best type of soil for its cultivation. The leading cotton producers are China, Pakistan, India, Australia, the USA, Greece, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Turkey.
