<h1><marquee> What is Farmer's Billing Accounting Software</marquee></h1>
  <p>
    <b>"Farm Management"</b> isn’t an easy task by any means.
    After a hectic all-day work routine out on the farm, the last thing farmers would worry about is managing the accounts.
    However, as with all businesses, farmers need to maintain accurate and neat accounting records to keep up with the financial management and productivity of the farm.</p>
    <p>
    This also means that like all other businesses, farmers need effective and efficient farm accounting software that may ease the management of their accounts burden.
    We call the farmer's the breadwinner of the world, but no one can understand as well as him what kind of problems these farmers have to face.
    But despite of all the hard work and facing all the difficulties, there is always happiness on his face.
    So here we caome with another good news for farmers, that is <u><b>"Agricultural Fertilizer's Accounting system"</b></u>, 
    that will be beneficial for both farmers and shopkeepers.</p>
    <p>
    The main objective of this project is that the records of purchase of farmers and sale of shopkeepers should saved online. 
    When a farmer buys seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, spraying drugs and similar agricultural necessities from the shopkeepers for sowing in his field, then that time shopkeer gives him a receipt for the goods bought and on that receipt, he writes to him what item he bought, how much money the farmer paid in cash and how much money was left. But it's data is not saved anywhere online. 
    And the kind on which he writes purchase account of each farmer.</p>
    <p>
    But it may sometimes happen that his account book is lost or the receipt given by him to the farmer is lost, then there can be confusion.
    So we are building a one of a kind billing software that will be great use to both farmers and shopkeepers.</p>
    <p>
    In this billing software we can create a farmer ID. And the generated ID text message will also go on the farmer's mobile number. 
    So that the ID will be useful to the shopkeeper and farmers so that, when a farmer goes to a shopkeeper to buy something, the shopkeeper can use his ID to give him the required item.
    By entering his ID which item he wants to buy, how much, date and time and most importantly how much has been paid for thatitem and how much is left, we can save the account online using that billing software. How will it be beneficial that all the data about farmer's purchases and shopkeeper's sales are saved in that software. And most important thing is that money dows not get mixed up.</p> 
    <p>
    The money accounts of shopkeepers and farmers will be clear. Both will benefit as the shopkeeper will need to write the entry in the notebook, and the farmers will also not need to take receipts. 
    And then this text message will be sent to the farmer's phone so that they also know what the farmer ID is, what date and time they bought and how much they bought, whether they paid in fullor left some.
    Here you can learn complete billing accounting software.</p>
